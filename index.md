**Slimcoin** is a novel and experimental cryptocurrency created in 2014. It is the first known coin that uses the [Proof of Burn](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Proof_of_burn) mechanism to generate blocks. Additionally, it uses Proof of Work and Proof of Stake, making it the first and unique coin with three different block generation mechanisms.

In 2017, we're alive and kicking, and we're **different** from most other "altcoin" communities. We have no hierarchic and centralized structure - so we have no *official development team* that benefits from dubious *pre-mine* or *insta-mine* mechanisms. We're not here mainly for profit like it's the case with most other altcoins.

All we want is to continue the exciting **Proof of Burn** experiment. You can read more about it [in our wiki](https://github.com/slimcoin-project/Slimcoin/wiki). 

In a few words, Proof of Burn is a mechanism where you get the right to find blocks if you burn coins. *Yes, you destroy your money* - and get a **long-term reward** winning the chance to get block rewards. Sounds crazy, huh? [Read more here - it has very interesting economical properties](https://github.com/slimcoin-project/Slimcoin/wiki/The-magic-of-Proof-of-Burn).

Some of us are planning exciting new features like a social network or a crowdfunding platform. **Stay tuned!**
