# The Slimcoin Project Website

The Slimcoin Project Website is a communication medium for the project participants and other interested community members. It will contain basic information about the Slimcoin cryptocurrency as well as a basic help section, complemented by the Wiki.

The website uses Jekyll, the default Github Pages generator. New pages can by added by adding text files in the Markdown format. If you want write access, you can request it in the Bitcointalk thread. Or you can simply fork the repository and do pull requests.

We want the Website to stay an open project, so we would like all contributions being licensed by an open content license. The license to use is yet not decided, but it should allow content re-distribution and modification.
